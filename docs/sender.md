## The Sender Chest and Eyes of Origin/Destination

The Sender Chest is a cool - but maybe _slightly_ over-powered - block that can be used to send items over any distance instantly (with costs and caveats attached!). The fuel for a sending items between a pair of Sender Chests is a pair of items called Eye of Origin and Eye of Destination. They're forged in pairs (or equal-sized stacks of pairs), where each craft gets a unique "key number". When an origin eye and destination eye with matching key numbers are each inserted into a different Sender Chest at the same time, the items in the origin are sent to the destination and the eyes are consumed.

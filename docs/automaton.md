## The Ancient Automaton

The Ancient Automaton is the original idea that started me on this data pack project. It's a block which must be placed in a specific configuration - similar to how the parts of a golem must be placed in the right pattern - to create one of 3 different crafting automation systems, which can be fed by hand, by dropper or by hopper to automatically craft items.

### Crafting Automaton
A 3x1x3 block structure where each block represents one of the slots of a crafting table. This is created by placing an ancient automaton into the middle of a circle of 8 crafting tables.

### Waxing Automaton 
A 2x1x1 block structure that can apply honeycombs to unwaxed copper items. This is created by placing an ancient automaton connected to any side (but not the top/bottom) of a honeycomb block. 

### Tinting Automaton
A 2x1x1 block structure that can craft 2-ingredient dyeing recipes and dye-mixing recipes. This is created by placing an ancient automaton connected to any side (but not the top/bottom) of any wool block.

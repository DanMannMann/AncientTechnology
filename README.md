## Ancient Technology

Ancient Technology is a data pack for vanilla Minecraft (1.17+) which adds blocks and items mostly aimed at technical players/redstoners, and which (I hope) are quite balanced and in the spirit of vanilla survival gameplay.

### [The Ancient Forge](docs/forge.md)
A custom crafting table, the Ancient Forge, is the entry point for Ancient Technology's items. It can be used to craft - or, rather, forge - other custom items and blocks included in the pack. The Ancient Forge is data driven, which means other data pack authors can add their recipes to it with a simple `data modify` command. 

One thing the Ancient Forge can't do is craft automatically. For that you need...

### [The Ancient Automaton](docs/automaton.md)
The Ancient Automaton is the original idea that started me on this data pack project. It's a block which must be placed in a specific configuration - similar to how the parts of a golem must be placed in the right pattern - to create one of 3 different crafting automation systems.

### [The Sender Chest & Eyes of Origin/Destination](docs/sender.md)
The Sender Chest is a cool - but maybe _slightly_ over-powered - block that can be used to send items over any distance instantly (with costs and caveats attached!). The fuel for a sending items between a pair of Sender Chests is a pair of items called Eye of Origin and Eye of Destination. They're forged in pairs (or equal-sized stacks of pairs), where each craft gets a unique "key number". When an origin eye and destination eye with matching key numbers are each inserted into a different Sender Chest at the same time, the items in the origin are sent to the destination and the eyes are consumed.

### The Ancient Anthology
A set of 6 written books providing in-game documentation for all the features of Ancient Technology.

There's no way I could've thrown this together in 3 weeks if I hadn't ~~ripped some people off~~ stood on the shoulders of the Minecraft command community's giants.

- Timber Forge on youtube - I learned this whole way of doing custom blocks from his vids, they're indispensible. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC606Jh3yjNj40dcVuMwtUCw
- radiish/TheSethskiGamer - the person who developed the "ilmango's crafting tables" autocrafting data pack. I learned how to make custom GUIs from that pack. My GUIs would suck without that knowledge. I also realise this pack is kinda doing the same thing theirs does (and they were here first!), but the differences between their timing/order based approach and my 3x3/fun-with-minecarts approach are big enough that I don't think any toes are stepped on. Theirs is a great pack and you should play with it! https://github.com/istanbul-not-constantinople/minecraft-autocrafting-datapack
